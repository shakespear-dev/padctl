# Reviewer Report: Phase 10 Wave 4 — Community Zero-Conflict (T17-T18)

## Review Scope

Reviewed: `brief.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, `test-plan.md`, `gardener-report.md`.
Cross-referenced: source files `validate_e2e_test.zig`, `cli_e2e_test.zig`.

## Checklist

### Completeness

- [x] Problem statement clear — hardcoded arrays cause merge conflicts for parallel contributors
- [x] All three hardcoded arrays identified with correct file/line/variable names
- [x] Solution reuses proven pattern from T12 (`collectTomlPaths`/`freeTomlPaths`)
- [x] Both implementation options (duplicate vs import) documented with tradeoff
- [x] Out-of-scope boundary well-defined (device-specific tests kept unchanged)
- [x] T18 (CONTRIBUTING.md) scoped to documentation update only

### Correctness

- [x] Line numbers in design.md match actual source (all_device_paths:14, device_paths:221, paths:167)
- [x] Device count guard `>= 12` matches current 12-device inventory
- [x] Section 2-4 tests correctly excluded — they test specific business logic values
- [x] Test rename from "all 5 device configs" to "all device configs" is appropriate

### Design Quality

- [x] D1 (duplicate rather than shared import) — reasonable for test isolation
- [x] D2 (keep device-specific tests unchanged) — correct, these test known expected values
- [x] D3 (minimum count guard >= 12) — prevents silent pass on wrong CWD

### Test Plan

- [x] TP1-TP3: functional coverage for Dir.walk replacement
- [x] TP4: grep guard against hardcoded arrays — good regression check
- [x] TP5: device-specific tests unchanged — regression guard
- [x] TP6-TP7: CONTRIBUTING.md accuracy checks
- [x] TP8-TP9: full regression guard

### Task Breakdown

- [x] T17a-T17e: logical decomposition, clear acceptance criteria
- [x] T18a-T18b: documentation tasks properly sequenced after T17

### Gardener Report

- [x] Gardener passed — no warnings, all cross-references verified

## Findings

No blocking issues found.

## Verdict

**PASS** — spec is ready for implementation. No blocking issues.
